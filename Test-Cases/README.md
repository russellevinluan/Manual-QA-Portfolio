# Test Cases

This folder contains detailed manual test cases designed
for the OrangeHRM demo application.

Each test case includes:

- Unique identifier
- Preconditions
- Step-by-step execution instructions
- Expected results
- Actual results after execution
- Status, severity, and priority (if applicable)

Test cases are aligned with the defined test scope
and traceable to documented defects where failures occurred.
