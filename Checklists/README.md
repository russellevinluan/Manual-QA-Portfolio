# Checklists

This folder contains exploratory and regression testing checklists
used to supplement structured test cases.

Checklists focus on:

- UI validation
- Authentication behavior
- Session management
- Basic security inspection
- Usability considerations

These checklists demonstrate risk-based and exploratory
testing practices beyond scripted test cases.
